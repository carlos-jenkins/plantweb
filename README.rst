Plantweb
========

Plantweb is a project that provides a command line interface, Sphinx directives
and an API that allows to render powerful plain text UML diagrams, ASCII
diagrams and complex graphs.

It is a Python client for the PlantUML_ server and thus it can render
PlantUML_, Graphviz_ and Ditaa_ diagrams without the need to install them.

Plantweb features a local cache that prevents requesting the server for
previously rendered diagrams, speeding up building documentation with lots of
diagrams.

Finally, being pure Python, non-local rendering, Plantweb is an excellent way
to display and render PlantUML_, Graphviz_ and Ditaa_ diagrams in ReadTheDocs_
published documentation.
